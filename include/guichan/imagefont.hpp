     * A font using an image containing the font data. ImageFont can be used
     * with any image supported by the currently used ImageLoader.
     *
     * These are two examples of an image containing a font.
     *  \image html imagefontexample.bmp
     *  \image html imagefontexample2.bmp
     *
     * The first pixel at coordinate (0,0) tells which color the image font 
     * looks for when seperating glyphs. The glyphs in the image is provided
     * to the image font's constructor in the order they appear in the image.
     *
     * To create an ImageFont from the first image example above the following
     * constructor call should be made:
     * @code gcn::ImageFont imageFont("fixedfont_big.bmp"," abcdefghijklmno\
pqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"); @endcode
     *
     * Noteworthy is that the first glyph actually gives the width of space.
     * Glyphs can, as seen in the second image example above, be seperated with
     * horizontal lines making it possible to draw glyphs on more then one
     * line in the image. However, these horizontal lines must have a height of
     * one pixel!
